				Angst of any kind.
				</h3>
				<h6>9/28/15</h6>
				<hr>
				<p>Paradigm shifter: In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Less-Traveled-Timeless-Edition/dp/0743243153">The Road Less Traveled,</a> M. Scott Peck describes depression as an appropriate response to frustration. It's not always something to be avoided. Have you ever felt nostalgic for depression? Apparently it activates reward centers in our brain, although differently(?)</p>
				<p>It's interesting, being thankful for depression, embracing it, and accepting. Meditation is great for letting go of frustration, and angst of any kind.</p>
				<p>Benefits of depression: You'll write things you wouldn't write feeling normal, and that expression is important, if you can make yourself sit down to write. Expressions of how you're feeling, whether through writing, painting, music; it feels good, like somebody understands. Depressing music: one of the best inventions. Good depressed music can be hard to find sometimes. Leave a comment if you've got just the thing. I like Josh Garrells and Bon Iver.</p>

				Virtue Vs. Morality 
				</h3>
				<h6>6/24/15</h6>
				<hr>
				<p>According to <a href="http://www.happinesshypothesis.com/">"The Happiness Hypothesis,"</a> a book I'm currently reading (and loving), Western Cultures tend to ruin morality by boiling it down to ethical dilemmas, as if one could always chose to do the right thing if one used appropriate logic. This view is helpful to keep our laws rather simple and straightforward, but it's a terrible way to live our lives, as it doesn't give us sufficient motivation to do the right thing, even if we could figure out what the right thing is, purely from logic.</p>
				<p>Why is it a terrible way to live our lives?</p>
				<p>Because a virtuous and happy life comes from habits and patterns of doing good --habits that are developed through discipline over time. This virtue approach allows one to both know what is right and to desire to do what is right, in many different contexts. And when I say "doing right," I don't just mean avoiding wrong. I mean living up to our potential, and making a difference in society.</p>
				<p>So how did the West get it wrong?</p>
				<p>We started to veer off track during the enlightenment.</p> 
				<p>Let me explain, as the book explained to me: The virtue approach to goodness is very ancient and is comprised of long lists of virtues, written in an emotionally compelling way, with anecdotes to serve as examples. They are very contextually applicable, and don't make very effective universal laws.</p>
				<p>During the enlightenment, as the scientific approach became paramount, contextually based anecdotes lost out to attempts at describing universal laws. The motivation behind the sentiment is admirable. Unfortunately, it was very hard to find "laws" of morality that everyone agreed upon, so they were mostly boiled down to property rights. As I said, this is actually a big step forward when it comes to conceiving law. It's a big step backward, however, as it basically qualifies goodness as avoiding bad behavior.</p>
				<p>Virtue, as described in the book, is a lot more than avoiding wrong, it's about becoming the best we can be. This might seem obvious, but I think our litigious culture and the dismal state of business ethics in America demonstrates that a lot of people are acting from the viewpoint of "Well, it's legal."</p>
				<p>What is needed, instead of a "you-can't-prove-it's-wrong" perspective, is a "how-much-good-can-I-accomplish?" attitude.</p>
				<p>As the author points out, this approach is not only better for society, it leads to a much greater level of fulfillment and happiness for the virtuous person.</p>
				<p>The book recounts the story of Benjamin Franklin, who focused on improving his character by improving his habits. Each week he would focus on a new virtue and record whether or not he was successful each day in living accordingly. His strategy of developing virtue went way beyond teasing out ethical dilemmas, it was focused on improving his habits and becoming a better person, no matter what scenario he found himself in. It was also about identifying his strengths and living up to his potential.</p>
				<p>I'm in a process now of trying to identify my strengths and live up to my potential. This discussion of virtue vs. morality inspired me to aim higher. It's helping me to identify habits I'd like to cultivate that will help me do a lot more good in the world. Like Franklin I'm going to start tracking my performance on daily goals. If anyone reading this is already doing a process like this, or would like to try it out, let me know, I'd love to see how it works for you. Together let's form habits that change our world for the better.</p>
