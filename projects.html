				Guided Meditation Prayer Path
				</h3>
				<h5>I'm a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/mindfulness">mindfulness</a> beginner, but one project I'm planning is a guided meditation experience. The idea is to have several stations in a room decorated white with candles for soft light. The stations have symbolic tasks, and a recording on the participants phone or ipod guides them through the stations. Each station is designed to  help participants process regrets and hopes, joys and fears, relationships and calling.</h5>
				<h5>Below is a rough draft of the first station, meant to help people relax and prepare for the experience.</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>By being alive you have the breath of life. Our breath is our constant connection to The Divine. In and out, back and forth, your breathing is dialogue. No matter what we may say about how we’re feeling or how we’re doing, our breath reveals the truth. Our breath constantly communicates our true perspective, whether it be gratitude, self-compassion, peace, joy, friendliness, anticipation</p>
				<p>or</p>
				<p>stress, resentment, fear, anxiety, depression, hurt, anger, selfishness, busy-ness, or boredom.</p>

				<p>What is your breath communicating to the all other living things? Think back over last week. How has your breathing felt? In a sense, your breathing has been speaking for you, on behalf of your spirit, so what has it been saying?</p>

				<p>Has it been generally positive or negative? By acknowledging our breathing, and by paying attention to how we’re breathing can be a helpful indicator of our psychological and emotional health and stability.</p>

				<p>No only that, choosing to breathe differently can be an important first step towards thinking differently, and living differently.</p>

				<p>So, you’ve identified what your breath has been expressing about your internal state of being. Take time now to breathe positively.</p>
				<p>Breathe with more gratitude.</p>

				<p>Breath with self-compassion.</p>

				<p>Breathe deep of peace, and of trust.</p>

				<p>After gratitude, self-compassion, and peace, breathe with openness and compassion towards others.</p>

				<p>Even if you still have negative feelings, or thoughts of your stresses and fears, allow those to rest, and choose to breath them out and away. You can’t clear your mind of thoughts, but you can choose to let your thoughts come and go freely, without stress or worry. Let thoughts come, let thoughts go, but always bring your attention back to your breath. You’re focus is your breathing. Pay close attention to your breath, how it feels, and what it is saying. Breathe deeply and openly. Listen to the sounds of your breathing, watch your diaphragm expand and contract, focus on how breathing feels, understanding that it is the breath of life, your constant connection to all of life, your connection to the divine.</p>

				<p>No matter what your current state of mind, start a change in your life by breathing positively.</p>

				<p>Breathe with honest self-compassion. Breathe in deeply, and let peace fill you completely. Breathe in hope, and breathe in trust.</p>
				<p>Breathe in openness, and breathe with compassion for everyone. Breath in anticipation, and hope for wonderful things soon to come.</p>
				<p>Let thoughts come, and let thoughts go.</p>
				<p>Take some time now to identify what your breath is expressing. Let yourself breathe positively and openly for 5 minutes while the music plays. At the end music, please proceed to the next station.</p>
