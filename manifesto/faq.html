<h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>What kind of “experiences” are you talking about, can you give an example? Why are they important?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I will create an audio version of an experience soon to be shared online. There’s no better way to explain something than to invite one to experience it, but a great creative experience is a blend of some of the following ingredients:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Guided introspection</li>
            <li>Metaphors, symbols, object lessons</li>
            <li>Spoken word (storytelling, poetry) music, dance, collaborative art</li>
            <li>Communal Silence</li>
            <li>Interactions in nature and natural features</li>
            <li>Experiences bond, creating value for most while beliefs divide and exclude.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
<li>What is Deep Ecumenism?</li>
  <ul>

  </ul>
<li>What do you mean by “the creation and development of their religious expression?”</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For some, it’s important to have the ability to contribute to the creation of their worship and religious experiences to find value in them, as opposed to only participating in services and liturgies that are largely predetermined. This goes deeper than just the ability to dress up the service in new ways, but would involve changing the fundamental nature of the service, which could express new religious understandings, so as to prevent the feeling that we’re always coming to the same answers, no matter how differently we present them.</li>
    </ul>
<li>What is “creative ceremony” and what is the nature of its “participatory and ongoing” creation?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A creative ceremony could be anything that would be helpful for the expression of spirituality or mindfulness and can be as unique as anything the participants imagine.</li>
        <li>It would be participatory in two aspects. The first aspect is participatory in the sense that anyone could create a ceremony or aspects of a ceremony. The second aspect is that the ceremony could be offered up to other members of the community for suggestions and refinement so as to benefit the community and not just the creator.</li>
        <li>The “ongoing” nature of the creation of these ceremonies refers to the concept that the creation and modification of the liturgy need never end, and that newer and older ideas can always be christened into use. This is inteded for those who benefit most from a religious experience if they play a part in creating it, instead of just observing or participating in an existing ceremony. A metaphor may help. Some people are external processors -- they learn a concept by talking about it. In the same way, some people are external processors in religious community, they learn about spirituality by creating spiritual experience. This is one of the primary departures from existing traditions, which usually come to stick with a small subset of available expressions instead of continuing to explore new methods. For example, evangelicals are known for their preaching, Catholics for Mass, Muslims for daily prayer, Quakers for silence, Sufi’s for spinning, Jews for Sabbath rest, etc. The ongoing creation of ceremony would allow this community to taste and experience variety of spiritual expression and practice. This is one of the attractive qualities of Indian religions - that they seem to draw from a wider palette of spiritual practices.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Why wouldn’t the community be evangelistic?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the exaggerations of many religions is the claim that they alone have exhaustive truth and that belief and adherence to that one religion is required for all members. Humility and equality requires this community to acknowledge from the outset that it does not have answers for everyone, and it’s not THE answer for anyone. It may play a beneficial role in some people’s lives but others may genuinely find no value in its practices or ideas.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Notes:</h1>
<p>Differences from Unitarian Universalism</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UU services are built around a speaker/sermon, not an experience.</li>
        <li>UU services have the look and feel of church, whereas this community could create something completely unique.</li>
    </ul>
